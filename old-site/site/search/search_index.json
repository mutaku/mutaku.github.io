We can go into a debate on what is AI vs machine learning; I would argue that machine learning really is a subset field of AI. But it's really the ability of a machine to learn from a set of rules, determine decisions, and in some circumstances, act on those decisions.</p> <p>Conway's Game of Life</p> <p>One example I really like to highlight to folks is Conway's Game of Life. You have a very rudimentary set of heuristics or rules of play, a board composed of a mesh grid, and a starting selection of randomized (or pseudo-randomized) start points that are \"active\" or \"alive\". The game then runs on its own based upon a turn system where all rules are evaluated and a live vs dead cell is determined based on these rules.</p> <p>What is so fascinating about this is that as scenarios play out, you will often see the creation of shapes that will emit objects that can collide and take out other, larger objects, or create additional satellites or projectiles. There is an entire field of mathematic study around the possible shapes and scenarios based on particular starting states.</p> <p>Today artificial intelligence can be seen everywhere: - In the lab: Identifying the impact of cancer therapeutic drugs on dividing cells in real time - In the clinic: Identifying tumor cells on images that are essentially obscured from the naked eye - In commerce: Putting ads and products in front of the right people</p> <p>AI and machine learning are truly everywhere and it's quite an exciting time for those of us in the field.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/11/09/summer_of_ai_-_an_agbiome_perspective/#ai-in-biotechnology","title":"AI in Biotechnology","text":""},{"location":"blog/2023/11/09/summer_of_ai_-_an_agbiome_perspective/#why-are-we-getting-into-this-space","title":"Why are we getting into this space?","text":"<p>As I mentioned, AI and machine learning are everywhere.
