About Matthew Martz
============================

My expertise is in building and leading teams of Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, Data Engineers, and Data Product experts of diverse experience levels, distributed across cultural and knowledge bases, to drive innovation, product development, and cutting edge, actionable research. I have a proven track record of mentoring, growing, executing, and building strategy around ambitious goals across the Data Science technical platform to provide business value.

My background is in Quantitative Cell Biology and I have a PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I spent much of my career researching novel cancer therapeutics through live cell imaging and machine learning. You can now find me developing and implementing machine learning platforms and algorithms for everything from optimization problems to personalized medicine and medicinal AI. I have researched and built novel recommenders, 24/7 production machine learning solutions, and received patents for personalization solutions in the consumer sales space and chemical profile recommenders.

Most recently, I have been working in the Biotechnology space where I have developed the long-term strategy and vision for Data Science, led a growing team of Data Scientists to develop novel algorithms in the predictive modeling and Bioinformatics spaces, and accelerated biological discovery. Moreover, I designed and implemented novel algorithms to detect differential modes of action in both natural products and whole microbe systems, and engineered a proprietary online learning platform to serve as an artificial intelligence decision guidance system for our extensive microbial collection and proprietary product discovery platform (Genesis), a digital twin. I rebuilt global research and enablement programs across domains for knowledge generation and product creation and delivery using cutting edge deep learning techniques on unstructured records, genomics, omics, and image data as the global lead for digital science discovery and delivery programs. Established, built, and implemented data governance and provenance at both the discovery and enterprise levels. Built multimodal knowledge graphs using LLM guidance to develop GraphRAG technologies in-house for production use in the global pipeline.

    Currently
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) - Multiple roles spanning teams
    Additional research focus is on modernizing predictive pipelines and modeling capabilities through the utilization of knowledge graphs, agentic agents, analytical AI, focusing on clinical implementation. I work primarily with Multimodal models and solution from naive builds to fine tuning foundation models and GraphRAG.
    My goal is to provide clinicians with predictive assesment data, therapeutic planning strategies, and risk identification and scoring to lower clinician fatigue and improve patient outcomes.
    As part of this work, I am currently developing an algorithm and model platform to identify cognitive complexity for each patient touchpoint and the summation to the clinician's day load.

    Owner/Creator and Team Lead - Knowledge Factory AI Platform - Rochester, MN

    As leader of a highly skilled team, I'm developing a cutting-edge, robust data platform. Engineered for multi-modal data, it integrates seamlessly with diverse databases and data lakes, facilitating real-time ingestion into a sophisticated knowledge graph. Our core mission is to transform complex, disparate data into actionable insights, driving advancements across various domains.

    We have achieved significant breakthroughs in developing proprietary algorithms and sophisticated workflows that adeptly manage multi-modal data, extracting value from both structured and unstructured sources. A cornerstone of our work lies in the creation, structuring, and iterative refinement of knowledge graphs, which are directly informed and enhanced by the outputs of our advanced AI-driven data processing. Our focus on optimizing data access and retrieval is crucial for both intricate agentic AI workflows, where autonomous systems require immediate access to information, and for advanced graph machine learning applications, including the development of highly accurate predictive models, sophisticated forecasting capabilities, and clinical digital twins in research and practice.

    Our team has successfully engineered and deployed intelligent agents and powerful toolchains to streamline data retrieval for complex question-answering flows. We've also developed methodologies for neighborhood and shortest path summarization, invaluable for comprehensive documentation and establishing a single source of truth (SSOT).

    Currently, we're deeply immersed in developing a robust execution graph for advanced agentic capabilities. This groundbreaking system will revolutionize operations and decision-making, from optimizing patient care to accelerating scientific research. It will enable our AI agents to perform complex, multi-step tasks, interact intelligently with various systems, and drive significant improvements in effectiveness and outcomes across critical Mayo Clinic domains.
