## Previous Platform Work

### Wine Recommendation & Personalization Engine
**Company**: Firstleaf
**Role**: Senior Data Scientist & ML Engineer
**Technology Stack**: Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS

Developed and deployed a sophisticated recommendation system serving personalized wine selections:

```python
# Example: Core recommendation algorithm architecture
class PersonalizationEngine:
    def __init__(self, model_config):
        self.collaborative_model = CollaborativeFilteringModel()
        self.content_model = ContentBasedModel()
        self.contextual_model = ContextualBandits()
        self.feature_store = FeatureStore()

    def generate_recommendations(self, user_id, context):
        # Multi-arm bandit approach for exploration/exploitation
        user_features = self.feature_store.get_user_features(user_id)
        contextual_features = self.extract_context_features(context)

        # Ensemble of recommendation strategies
        collab_recs = self.collaborative_model.recommend(user_features)
        content_recs = self.content_model.recommend(user_features)
        contextual_recs = self.contextual_model.recommend(
            user_features, contextual_features
        )

        return self.ensemble_recommendations([
            collab_recs, content_recs, contextual_recs
        ])
```

**Impact**:
- Increased customer satisfaction scores by 23%

- Reduced customer service inquiries by 15%

### Decision Tree Analysis & Explainability System

Built comprehensive tools for analyzing and explaining ML model decisions:

```python
# Example: Model explanation system
class ModelExplainer:
    def __init__(self, model, feature_names):
        self.model = model
        self.feature_names = feature_names
        self.explainer = TreeExplainer(model)

    def explain_prediction(self, instance):
        # Generate SHAP values for explanation
        shap_values = self.explainer.shap_values(instance)

        # Extract decision path
        decision_path = self.extract_decision_path(instance)

        # Create human-readable explanation
        explanation = self.generate_natural_language_explanation(
            shap_values, decision_path, instance
        )

        return {
            'prediction': self.model.predict(instance)[0],
            'confidence': self.calculate_confidence(instance),
            'explanation': explanation,
            'feature_importance': self.rank_feature_importance(shap_values),
            'decision_path': decision_path
        }
```

## Open Source Contributions

### Data Science Utilities
While most platform work is proprietary, here are some representative utility functions and patterns:

```python
# Dynamic Time Warping for time series analysis
class DTW:
    """Distance Time Warping implementation for chemistry time series."""

    def __init__(self, v1, v2, dist=lambda x, y: (x - y) ** 2):
        self.distance_matrix = self._calculate_distance_matrix(v1, v2, dist)
        self.cost_matrix = self._calculate_cost_matrix()
        self.distance = self.cost_matrix[-1, -1]

    @property
    def path(self):
        """Extract optimal alignment path."""
        return self._backtrack_optimal_path()

# Standardized data container for ML pipelines
@dataclass
class StandardizedData:
    preprocessor: preprocessing.StandardScaler
    data: pd.DataFrame
    standardized_data: pd.DataFrame = field(init=False)

    def __post_init__(self):
        self.preprocessor = self.preprocessor()
        self.standardized_data = pd.DataFrame(
            self.preprocessor.fit_transform(self.data),
            columns=self.data.columns,
            index=self.data.index
        )
```

## Technical Philosophy

My approach to technical work emphasizes:

1. **Production-First Thinking**: Designing for scale, reliability, and maintainability from day one
2. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Comprehensive metrics, A/B testing, and impact measurement
3. **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Bridging technical capabilities with business value
4. **Continuous Learning**: Staying current with emerging technologies while maintaining proven patterns
