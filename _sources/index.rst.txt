Welcome to Mutaku - the writings of Matthew Martz
==================================


My background is in Quantitative Cell Biology and I have a PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
I spent much of my career researching novel cancer therapeutics through live cell imaging and machine learning.
You can now find me developing and implementing machine learning platforms and algorithms for everything from 
optimization problems to personalized medicine and medicinal AI. Find more about me here: :ref:`about`
