My expertise is in building and leading teams of Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, Data Engineers, and Data Product experts of diverse experience levels, distributed across cultural and knowledge bases, to drive innovation, product development, and cutting edge, actionable research. I have a proven track record of mentoring, growing, executing, and building strategy around ambitious goals across the Data Science technical platform to provide business value.

My current research focuses on modernizing predictive pipelines and modeling capabilities using knowledge graphs, agentic AI, and analytical AI, with a strong emphasis on clinical implementation. I specialize in multimodal models, ranging from naive builds to fine-tuning foundation models and GraphRAG, aiming to provide clinicians with predictive assessment data, therapeutic planning strategies, and risk identification to improve patient outcomes and reduce fatigue. I am also developing an algorithm and model platform to identify and quantify cognitive complexity in patient interactions and clinicians' daily workloads.My collective experience in advanced AI, knowledge graph development, and multimodal modeling is strategically directed towards pioneering the creation of comprehensive patient digital twins for transformative impact in both clinical practice and research.My core research endeavors are dedicated to revolutionizing predictive healthcare through the strategic integration of cutting-edge AI methodologies. Specifically, I focus on modernizing predictive pipelines and enhancing modeling capabilities by leveraging the synergistic power of knowledge graphs, agentic AI, and analytical AI. A paramount aspect of this work is its strong emphasis on clinical implementation, ensuring that theoretical advancements translate into tangible improvements in patient care.

My specialization lies in the domain of multimodal models. This encompasses a broad spectrum of approaches, ranging from the development of foundational, "naive" builds to the sophisticated fine-tuning of pre-trained foundation models. A particular area of expertise is GraphRAG, which combines the strengths of knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of predictive insights. The overarching goal of these efforts is to equip clinicians with robust predictive assessment data, actionable therapeutic planning strategies, and early risk identification capabilities. By doing so, we aim to significantly improve patient outcomes, optimize care pathways, and reduce the burden of clinician fatigue, thereby fostering a more efficient and effective healthcare system.

Beyond predictive modeling, I am also actively engaged in the development of an innovative algorithm and model platform designed to objectively identify and quantify cognitive complexity within patient interactions and the daily workloads of clinicians. This initiative seeks to provide a granular understanding of the demands placed on healthcare providers, paving the way for optimized workflows and improved clinician well-being.

Collectively, my extensive experience in advanced AI, sophisticated knowledge graph development, and nuanced multimodal modeling is strategically directed towards a pioneering vision: the creation of comprehensive patient digital twins. These digital twins are envisioned as dynamic, continuously evolving representations of individual patients, amalgamating diverse data streams to provide a holistic and real-time understanding of their health status. The ultimate aim of this transformative endeavor is to profoundly impact both clinical practice and medical research, ushering in an era of personalized, predictive, and proactive healthcare.

My background is in Quantitative Cell Biology and I have a PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I spent much of my career researching novel cancer therapeutics through live cell imaging and machine learning. You can now find me developing and implementing machine learning platforms and algorithms for everything from optimization problems to personalized medicine and medicinal AI. I have researched and built novel recommenders, 24/7 production machine learning solutions, and received patents for personalization solutions in the consumer sales space and chemical profile recommenders.

Most recently, I have been working in the Biotechnology space where I have developed the long-term strategy and vision for Data Science, led a growing team of Data Scientists to develop novel algorithms in the predictive modeling and Bioinformatics spaces, and accelerated biological discovery. Moreover, I designed and implemented novel algorithms to detect differential modes of action in both natural products and whole microbe systems, and engineered a proprietary online learning platform to serve as an artificial intelligence decision guidance system for our extensive microbial collection and proprietary product discovery platform (Genesis), a digital twin. I rebuilt global research and enablement programs across domains for knowledge generation and product creation and delivery using cutting edge deep learning techniques on unstructured records, genomics, omics, and image data as the global lead for digital science discovery and delivery programs. Established, built, and implemented data governance and provenance at both the discovery and enterprise levels. Built multimodal knowledge graphs using LLM guidance to develop GraphRAG technologies in-house for production use in the global pipeline.

    Owner/Creator and Team Lead - Knowledge Factory AI Platform - Rochester, MN

    As leader of a highly skilled team, I'm developing a cutting-edge, robust data platform. Engineered for multi-modal data, it integrates seamlessly with diverse databases and data lakes, facilitating real-time ingestion into a sophisticated knowledge graph. Our core mission is to transform complex, disparate data into actionable insights, driving advancements across various domains.

    We have achieved significant breakthroughs in developing proprietary algorithms and sophisticated workflows that adeptly manage multi-modal data, extracting value from both structured and unstructured sources. A cornerstone of our work lies in the creation, structuring, and iterative refinement of knowledge graphs, which are directly informed and enhanced by the outputs of our advanced AI-driven data processing. Our focus on optimizing data access and retrieval is crucial for both intricate agentic AI workflows, where autonomous systems require immediate access to information, and for advanced graph machine learning applications, including the development of highly accurate predictive models, sophisticated forecasting capabilities, and clinical digital twins in research and practice.

    Our team has successfully engineered and deployed intelligent agents and powerful toolchains to streamline data retrieval for complex question-answering flows. We've also developed methodologies for neighborhood and shortest path summarization, invaluable for comprehensive documentation and establishing a single source of truth (SSOT).

    Currently, we're deeply immersed in developing a robust execution graph for advanced agentic capabilities. This groundbreaking system will revolutionize operations and decision-making, from optimizing patient care to accelerating scientific research. It will enable our AI agents to perform complex, multi-step tasks, interact intelligently with various systems, and drive significant improvements in effectiveness and outcomes across critical Mayo Clinic domains.
