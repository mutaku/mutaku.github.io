# About Matthew Martz

## Professional Profile

My expertise is in **building and leading teams** of Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, Data Engineers, and Data Product experts of diverse experience levels, distributed across cultural and knowledge bases, to drive innovation, product development, and cutting-edge, actionable research. I have a proven track record of mentoring, growing, executing, and building strategy around ambitious goals across the Data Science technical platform to provide business value.

!!! research "Current Research Focus"
    My current research focuses on **modernizing predictive pipelines** and **modeling capabilities** using knowledge graphs, agentic AI, and analytical AI, with a strong emphasis on clinical implementation. I specialize in multimodal models, ranging from naive builds to fine-tuning foundation models and GraphRAG.

## Academic Background

My background is in **Quantitative Cell Biology** and I have a **PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology**. I spent much of my career researching novel cancer therapeutics through live cell imaging and machine learning. You can now find me developing and implementing machine learning platforms and algorithms for everything from optimization problems to personalized medicine and medicinal AI.

## Vision: Patient Digital Twins

> My collective experience in advanced AI, sophisticated knowledge graph development, and nuanced multimodal modeling is strategically directed towards a pioneering vision: the creation of **comprehensive patient digital twins**.

These digital twins are envisioned as dynamic, continuously evolving representations of individual patients, amalgamating diverse data streams to provide a holistic and real-time understanding of their health status. The ultimate aim of this transformative endeavor is to profoundly impact both clinical practice and medical research, ushering in an era of personalized, predictive, and proactive healthcare.
