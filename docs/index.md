## Current Research Focus

I'm pioneering the development of **comprehensive healthcare AI platforms** that transform the largest untapped opportunity in modern medicine‚Äîthe billions of patient interactions and outcomes locked in fragmented systems.

**My Platform Addresses Healthcare's Core Challenge**: Less than 3% of healthcare's 2.5 exabytes of daily data is used for predictive analytics, representing massive underutilization that could revolutionize patient care.

**What I've Built**:

- **2.3 million patient knowledge graph** demonstrating scalable AI platform capabilities
- **Privacy-preserving federated learning** enabling multi-site collaboration without data sharing
- **Clinical workflow integration** with 15+ interfaces and 100+ service methods
- **Patient digital twins** for precision medicine at population scale

!!! research "Healthcare AI Platform Innovation"
    Currently developing advanced algorithms that integrate clinical, genomic, and pathway data to create comprehensive **patient digital twins** for transformative clinical impact. This work combines 17 years of production ML/AI experience with deep clinical domain expertise.
