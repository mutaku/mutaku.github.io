About Matthew Martz
============================

My background is in Quantitative Cell Biology and I have a PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
I spent much of my career researching novel cancer therapeutics through live cell imaging and machine learning.
You can now find me developing and implementing machine learning platforms and algorithms for everything from
optimization problems to personalized medicine and medicinal AI. In recent years I have researched and built
novel recommenders, 24/7 production machine learning solutions, and received patents for personalization solutions
in the consumer sales space and chemical profile recommenders.

Most recently, I have been working in the Biotechnology space where I have developed the strategy and vision for Data Science, lead the team of Data Scientists, brought in-house innovative technologies and approaches to solve large scale research and product develop problems, developed novel algorithms in the predictive modeling and Bioinformatics spaces, driven biological research from Data Science, designed and implemented novel algorithms to detect differential modes of action in both natural products and whole microbe systems, and engineered a proprietary online learning platform to serve as an artificial intelligence decision guidance system for our extensive microbial collection and proprietary product discovery platform (GENESIS).

    Currently
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Head of Data Science and Technical Lead at AgBiome

    Led a growing team of Data Scientists working to drive biological research and accelerate product development.

    Developed and drove 4 year strategy and vision for Data Science, Data Engineering, Bioinformatics, and Data Product for entire organization.

    Served as Data Science liaison across the company, communicating strategy, accomplishments, initiatives, and best practices. Developed the long-term Data Science strategy and vision, hiring plan, technological innovation pipeline, and overall project management for the department.

    Developed a proprietary predictive artificial intelligence decision guidance system to serve as a core to our proprietary natural and whole microbe product discovery platform.

    Led Data Science contribution to external manuscripts and internal white papers for both research, Data Science, and SOPs.

    Sat on a team of technical leaders that drove research initiatives across the company and served as a hive mind to solve challenges across domains. Identified and addressed gaps in research and Data Science.

    Developed a novel algorithm to use interpretable machine learning model ensembles to traverse genomic annotations and drive mode of action discovery from small datasets. Further, developed a predictive modeling platform to accelerate product discovery in indication screening. Worked on developing, and began implementation of, a cross-indication prediction platform to enable multi-target identification.

    Previously
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Principal, Research and Machine Learning and Head of Data Science at Penrose Hill/Firstleaf

    Created and maintain the core algorithms behind the Firstleaf wine club.

    Leading a team of Data Scientists and Machine Learning engineers developing machine learning and AI platforms
    to drive real time recommendations, inform business strategy, and create/integrate with product design life cycle.
    This includes the end-to-end development of the ML stack using both traditional ML and cutting edge deep learning techniques, along with novel algorithm development.

    The Research and Machine Learning team is responsible for identifying and developing key Data Science and Machine Learning technologies for Firstleaf.
    We utilize cutting edge approaches to both empower internal company function as well as consumer facing products.
    The team is also responsible for the design and implementation of the algorithms behind our patented personalization technologies that drive the Firstleaf experience.
