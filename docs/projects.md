# Projects & Technical Work

This page showcases selected technical projects and implementations that demonstrate expertise in AI, machine learning, and healthcare technology platforms.

## Current Focus: Healthcare AI Platform Development

**Addressing Healthcare's Core Challenge**: Less than 3% of healthcare's 2.5 exabytes of daily data is used for predictive analytics, representing the largest untapped opportunity in modern medicine.

### Comprehensive Healthcare AI Platform - Digital Twins at Scale

**Role**: Creator and Principal Architect and Lead
**Stack**: Python, Reflex, Neo4j, PyTorch Geometric, Redis, Federated Learning
**Scale**: Population-scale precision medicine across health systems

Building a transformative platform that addresses healthcare AI's fundamental failures through three core innovations:

#### **1. Knowledge Graph-Based Patient Intelligence**

- **2.3 million patient knowledge graph** demonstrating pipeline scalability
- **Multi-modal data integration**: Clinical trials (66K studies), genomic variants (3.9M), imaging data (1.2M studies), drug references (1.3K compounds)
- **Patient digital twins** for precision medicine combining clinical, genomic, and pathway data
- Moving beyond tabular approaches to model patients within rich relational contexts

#### **2. Privacy-Preserving Multi-Site Collaboration**

- **Federated learning infrastructure** enabling hospitals to collaboratively train AI models without sharing patient data
- **HIPAA-compliant architecture** unlocking 10-100x larger training datasets
- **Cross-institutional research** without data centralization barriers
- Real-world deployment across health system partners

#### **3. Clinical Workflow Integration with AI Workbenches**

- **15+ clinical interfaces** and **100+ service methods** for healthcare workflow integration
- **Real-time clinical decision support** with transparent reasoning and uncertainty quantification
- **Advanced prediction models** for 1-12 month outcome forecasting using temporal graph neural networks
- **Clinical dashboard platform** designed for real-world adoption rather than academic benchmarks

#### **Research & Discovery Capabilities**

- **Biomarker discovery pipeline** using graph-based analysis
- **Drug repurposing** through AI-powered hypothesis generation
- **Treatment pathway optimization** via digital twin simulations
- **Automated clinical trial design** and patient matching platform

**Market Opportunity & Platform Potential**:

*Note: Platform is in development/research phase - these represent industry benchmarks and potential impact for a platform like this:*

- Healthcare AI represents $45 billion market opportunity by 2026
- Research shows 15-30% reduction potential in preventable hospital readmissions through predictive models
- Studies demonstrate 48-72 hour advance prediction capability for clinical deterioration
- Value-based care models show $2,000-5,000 potential cost savings per prevented readmission

**Current Platform Status**: Research and development phase with 2.3M patient demonstration dataset showing scalability and technical feasibility

    def __init__(self, model, feature_names):
        self.model = model
        self.feature_names = feature_names
        self.explainer = TreeExplainer(model)

    def explain_prediction(self, instance):
        # Generate SHAP values for explanation
        shap_values = self.explainer.shap_values(instance)

        # Extract decision path
        decision_path = self.extract_decision_path(instance)

        # Create human-readable explanation
        explanation = self.generate_natural_language_explanation(
            shap_values, decision_path, instance
        )

        return {
            'prediction': self.model.predict(instance)[0],

## Technical Philosophy

My approach to technical work emphasizes:

1. **Production-First Thinking**: Designing for scale, reliability, and maintainability from day one
2. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Comprehensive metrics, A/B testing, and impact measurement
3. **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Bridging technical capabilities with business value
4. **Continuous Learning**: Staying current with emerging technologies while maintaining proven patterns
