About Matthew Martz
============================

My background is in Quantitative Cell Biology and I have a PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
I spent much of my career researching novel cancer therapeutics through live cell imaging and machine learning.
You can now find me developing and implementing machine learning platforms and algorithms for everything from
optimization problems to personalized medicine and medicinal AI. In recent years I have researched and built
novel recommenders, 24/7 production machine learning solutions, and received patents for personalization solutions
in the consumer sales space and chemical profile recommenders. Find more about me here: :ref:`about`

    Currently
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Principal, Research and Machine Learning and Head of Data Science at Penrose Hill/Firstleaf

    Created and maintain the core algorithms behind the Firstleaf wine club.

    Leading a team of Data Scientists and Machine Learning engineers developing machine learning and AI platforms
    to drive real time recommendations, inform business strategy, and create/integrate with product design life cycle.
    This includes the end-to-end development of the ML stack using both traditional ML and cutting edge deep learning techniques, along with novel algorithm development.

    The Research and Machine Learning team is responsible for identifying and developing key Data Science and Machine Learning technologies for Firstleaf.
    We utilize cutting edge approaches to both empower internal company function as well as consumer facing products.
    The team is also responsible for the design and implementation of the algorithms behind our patented personalization technologies that drive the Firstleaf experience.
